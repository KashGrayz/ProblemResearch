#PROBLEM SOLVING I

# Declare a variable called favorite_number and store your favorite or lucky number within it. 
# Use the random module to generate a random number between a range that includes your favorite number.
# Determine how many numbers away the random number was from your favorite number
# Create a while loop that generates a random number and checks if it matches your favorite number.
# Keep track of how many times the computer has guessed.
# Once the computer guesses the correct number, display a message explaining how many attempts it took the computer to guess your favorite number.

#PROBLEM SOLVING II

# Write code that takes a string as input and returns the string reversed
#i.e. “Hello” will be returned as “olleH”

#Word reverserizor
# words = input("What's the word?\n")
# drow_ver = ''

# for drow in range(len(words) -1, -1, -1):
#     drow_ver += words[drow]
# print(drow_ver)

# Write code that takes a string as input and 
# capitalize the first letter of each word. Words will be separated by only one space. 
# i.e. “hello world” should be outputted as “Hello World”

# Cap my words
# cap_my_word = input("Cap what?\n")
# result = string.capwords(cap_my_word)
# print(result)

# cap_my_word2 = input("Cap what?\n")
# first_l = cap_my_word2[0]
# rest_l = cap_my_word2[1:]
# result = first_l.upper() + rest_l
# print(result)

# A “palindrome” is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward i.e. madam	
# Write code that takes a user input and checks to see if it is a Palindrome and reports the result

palindrome = input("Is it a palindrome?\n")

answer = ''

for drome in range(len(palindrome) -1, -1, -1):
    answer += palindrome[drome]

if answer == palindrome:
     print("Succes")
else:
    print("Fail!")

#Compress a string of characters
# For example, an input of "aaabbbbbccccaacccbbbaaabbbaaa" would compress to "3a5b4c2a3c3b3a3b3a"

# condense_this = input("What would you like to condense?\n")
